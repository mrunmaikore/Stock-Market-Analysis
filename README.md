ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project presents an end-to-end Market Analysis and Stock Price Forecasting solution that combines machine learning with business intelligence tools to deliver actionable insights from historical stock data.

Using Python, the dataset was cleaned and transformed through feature engineering techniques, such as moving averages, lag variables, and volatility calculations. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and trends in price movements and trading volume.

For prediction, machine learning models including Random Forest and XGBoost were trained to forecast stock closing prices. Model performance was evaluated using regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score to ensure accuracy and generalizability.

The final output was visualized using Power BI, creating a rich, interactive dashboard featuring:

ðŸ“ˆ Line and Candlestick Charts to show price trends over time

ðŸ”„ Moving Averages and Volatility Indicators for trend smoothing and risk insight

ðŸ“Š Trading Volume Analysis with custom tooltips

ðŸ§® DAX Measures for % price change, moving averages, and growth tracking

ðŸ”Ž Drill-through Pages and Slicers for in-depth exploration

This project demonstrates how data science and BI tools can be integrated to support decision-making in financial domains by bridging the gap between complex machine learning outputs and user-friendly dashboards.
